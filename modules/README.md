# Modules
This folder contains the modules.

## Contributing guidelines
Modules MUST be specified as XML files with corresponding m-files, starting with "reproa_", either with the same basename or explicit reference in the header using the "mfile" attribute.

Modules are RECOMMENDED to be organised into subfolders.

See https://github.com/reprostat/reproanalysis for an example layout.
